# Personal Knowledge Management


Are you tired of organizing your folder structure? Do you find it difficult to remember where to place a new file, or struggle when searching for an old one? This system aims to solve these pain points.

Simply tell the system the knowledge you’ve just gained or want to store, and it will record it for you. You can easily fetch it whenever you need it. No need to worry about how the knowledge is organized—just let your personal copilot manage everything for you.
